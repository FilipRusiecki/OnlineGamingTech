	Alice and Bob wish to communicate with each other over the Internet. Each uses RSA, the common asymmetric cryptography protocol. 
	Thus, each has his/her own private key and knows the public key of the other. Let us denote private key of Alice as Pr(A), 
	private key of Bob as Pr(B), public key of Alice as Pu(A), and public key of Bob as Pu(B). 

Please use the following notation in presenting your answers:
E_K (M): Message M is encrypted using key K
D_K (M): Message M is decrypted using key K

	Alice wants to send a message to Bob so that no one else can read it. Let us denote the message as M_1. 
	How would Alice send the message? 
	
	Answer: 
	1. the public key (Pu(B)) of Bob.
	2. Use the encryption notation E_Pu(B)(M_1) to encrypt the message (M_1) using Bob's public key (Pu(B)).
	3. Send Bob over the Internet the encrypted message (E_Pu(B)(M_1)).
	4. The encrypted message (E_Pu(B)(M_1)) is delivered to Bob.
	5. With the decryption notation D_Pr(B)(E_Pu(B)(M_1), Bob decrypts the message with his private key (Pr(B)).
    6. Bob gets the decrypted version's original plaintext message (M_1) from it.

	Let us denote the message Alice sent as M_1 How would Bob decipher the message?
	
	Answer: Therefore, to decipher the message (M_1, Bob performs the decryption operation using his private 
	key (Pr(B)) on the received encrypted message (E_Pu(B)(M_1).
	This allows him to recover the original plaintext message sent by Alice.

	In this situation, Alice does not care if anyone can read her message. But she does care that no one in 
	the middlecan change the message (in an undetectable manner). Let us denote the message as M_2.
	
	Answer: Alice can employ a digital signature technique to make sure that no one in the middle can change 
	the message (in an undetectable way) while she is communicating with Bob. In this scenario, Alice would
	sign the message M_2 with her private key (Pr(A)), and Bob would use her public key (Pu(A)) to confirm 
	the signature.
	
	The process would be as follows:
	1. Using her private key (Pr(A)), Alice signs the message M_2 as follows:Â Sign_A = D_Pr(A)(M_2).
	2. Alice sends both the message M_2 and the signature Sign_A to Bob.
	3. Bob receives the message M_2 and the signature Sign_A.
	4. Bob verifies the signature using Alice's public key (Pu(A)):Verify_A = E_Pu(A)(Sign_A)
	5. If Verify_A matches the calculated signature from Step 4 and the verification is successful, Bob can 
	   be sure that the message M_2 came from Alice and was not tampered with in route.

	What would Bob do to verify that the message indeed came from Alice?		
	Answer: 
	1. Alice sends Bob the message M_2 along with the signature Sign_A.
	2. By encrypting Sign_A, Bob uses Alice's public key (Pu(A)) to validate the signature.
		Sign_A = E_Pu(A)(Verify_A)
	3. Bob contrasts the received signature Sign_A with the calculated verification value Verify_A.
		Bob is able to authenticate that Alice sent the message M_2 if Verify_A and Sign_A are in agreement.
		Verify_A must match Sign_A for the signature to be genuine; otherwise, it may have been tampered with 
		or came from an unapproved source.
